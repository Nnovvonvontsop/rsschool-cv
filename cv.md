I strive to learn new things and generate new ideas using the experience gained. I want to develop in IT in order to keep up with the progress in the future. I believe that technology conquers the world and we need to keep up with the times. I have been programming for about 5 months and create simple web pages. I want to learn more and gain experience in real projects.
